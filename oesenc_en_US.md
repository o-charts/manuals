# oeSENC Charts Conditions

- oeSENC charts can only be used in OpenCPN.

- You are allowed to use every chart you buy in 2 *systems* simultaneously or you can save a backup to be used in case your main *system* dies.

- *System* is the combination of device and OS. If any of these items changes, your system will be presented as a new one, you will lose your license and you will have to use your backup.

- If you have consumed your 2 shots and you want to use your charts in 2 extra systems, you will have to buy the charts again.

- A USB Key Dongle is considered as a system. The USB Key Dongle allows to install the oeSENC charts in as many devices as you want. However, only in the device where the USB Key Dongle is plugged in, the license is active and will display the charts.

- Your license should survive to any OS, OpenCPN or plugin update but if you reinstall your OS you will lose your license.

- Once you have requested your charts for one system we can not refund you. If you have created and assigned a system to your chart but you have not requested your charts yet, we can still refund you.

- Once you have requested your charts for one system we can not cancel or move your system to a different device/OS combination.

- You will be able to update your charts during a year from the purchase date. Charts have different update periodicity:

    - Weekly: DE, FR, SE, NO, FI, PL, Caribbean, IT, EE.
    - Fortnightly: AU, DK, GL, FO.
    - Monthly: CA.
    - Quarterly: UK, ES, BE, NL, HR, IS.

- Your charts expire after a year from the purchase date. After expiration, charts will keep working on your system but you can not request updates for them any longer.

- During the one years period you can add your parallel or backup system. Once the licensing period is over, this will not be possible any longer.

1. Plug the USB Key Dongle into a USB port.
    
2. Go to OpenCPN, Options → Plugins → oeSENC and enable it. Create a **USB key System ID file** (Fingerprint) from Preferences. The plugin will report the path to the file. For Windows and macOS systems a copy is created directly on the desktop. For Linux systems the file is created on ~/.opencpn folder.

4. Go to [o-charts shop](https://o-charts.org/shop/index.php?id_category=8&controller=category) and license the chart sets you are interested in. Ignore this step if you have already bought your charts.

7. Make a Request clicking the button that will appear on the column *Last requested* and the chart set will be processed. Processing time depends on the chart set size, the queue on the server and the network charge at that moment but will be never more than 2 hours. Actually we are talking about minutes.
